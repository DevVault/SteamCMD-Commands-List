# SteamCMD-Commands-List
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dgibbs64/SteamCMD-Commands-List.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dgibbs64/SteamCMD-Commands-List)
##Description

SteamCMD does not have a "list all" command to get all command options within SteamCMD.
Instead you have to use `find <string>`.
This script outputs all the commands available and saves it to a file.

## Usage

Simply download the script and run it.

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgibbs64/SteamCMD-Commands-List/master/steamcmdcommands.sh;chmod +x steamcmdcommands.sh;./steamcmdcommands.sh

## List
You can get the output without using the script.

> become out of date.
