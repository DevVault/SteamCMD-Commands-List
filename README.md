# SteamCMD-Commands-List

##Description

SteamCMD does not have a "list all" command to get all command options within SteamCMD.
Instead you have use find <string>
This script outputs all the commands available and saves it to a file

## Usage:

Simply download the script and run it

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgibbs64/SteamCMD-Commands-List/master/steamcmdcommands.sh''''
	chmod +x steamcmdcommands.sh
	./steamcmdcommands.sh

## List
You can get the output without using the script
note: if there are new commands/convars introduced this list may become out of date.
